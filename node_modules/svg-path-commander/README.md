# SVG Path Commander

[![SVG Path Commander](assets/apple-touch-icon.png)](https://thednp.github.io/svg-path-commander/)

A modern set of ES6+ JavaScript tools for manipulating the `d` (description) attribute for *SVGPathElement* items, and is implementing modern JavaScript API to produce reusable path strings with lossless quality.

While you may find familiar tools inside, this library brings ***new additions***:
* a tool that can *reverse path draw direction* without altering path commands, even with specific shorthand path commands;
* a unique tool that can *reverse path draw direction* for path strings with only 'C' path commands;
* a new and unique tool to *apply transform functions to path commands* via the modern DOMMatrix API.

**The key differences with other libraries**:
* ES6+ sourced with modernized codebase and build tools; all inherited codebase has been modernized as well;
* you can use this library in both web apps and Node.js, where others are restricted to a single environment;
* path command transformations are all consistent with the SVG coordinates system, where others compute transform origin only for rotation transformation;
* as you will see below, our library can create 3D to 2D projections, making your SVGs look like 3D but in the SVG coordinate system.

**SVGPathCommander** implements the [DOMMatrix API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMMatrix) for *SVGPathElement* path command transformation and falls back to a modernized [CSSMatrix shim](https://github.com/thednp/DOMMatrix) on older browsers as well as Node.js.
There are a couple of good reasons for this implementation:
* *WebKitCSSMatrix* and *SVGMatrix* APIs are slowly pushed away by DOMMatrix, the green light for new and modern implementations;
* we can actually apply a [3D transformation](https://github.com/ndebeiss/svg3d) matrix to SVG path commands, by calculating a 2D projection of the actual shape in 3D coordinates;
* when most tools available will be rendered absolete, we are ready for new challenges.

# What Is It For?

* converting and optimizing *SVGPathElement* for use in third party application; our [KUTE.js](https://github.com/thednp/kute.js) animation engine is using it to process *SVGPathElement* coordinates for [SVG morphing](https://thednp.github.io/kute.js/svgMorph.html) and [SVG cubic morphing](https://thednp.github.io/kute.js/svgCubicMorph.html);
* animators that work with SVGs and need tools for performing specific path command processing;
* font-icon creators can use it in both Node.js and web applications to process and test their creations.

# ESLint
Some of the sources for the library recommend using the following ESLint rule:

```js
rules: {
  // Disable bitwise for isArcCommand & isPathCommand
  "no-bitwise": 0,
}
```


# Technical Considerations

* as already mentioned, the `optimize()` method will not simplify/merge the path commands or determine and create shorthand notations; you might need [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo) and its `convertPathData` plugin; however, while computing path command values, the library will try to deliver the best outcome in path reverse or transformation;
* all tools processing path segments will always round float values to 3 decimals; EG: 0.5666 => 0.566, 0.50 => 0.5; you can change the default option with `SVGPathCommander.options.decimals = 2` or remove the value rounding all together with `SVGPathCommander.options.round = 0`; you can also control this feature via instance options;
* the `getSVGMatrix` utility we developed will always compute the matrix by applying the transform functions in the following order: `translate`, `rotate`, `skew` and `scale`, which is the default composition/recomposition order specified in the W3C draft;
* all 3d transformations as well as skews will convert `A` (arc) path commands to `C` (cubic bezier) due to the lack of resources on 3D to 2D projection;
* most tools included with **SVGPathCommander** should work in your Node.js apps, but if you choose to use other complimentary 3rd party libraries, make sure you have the proper tools for them;
* other path commands like `R` (catmulRomBezier), `O`, `U` (ellipse and shorthand ellipse) are not present in the current draft and they are not supported;
* normalization can mean many things to many people and our library is developed to convert path command values to absolute and shorthand to non-shorthand commands to provide a solid foundation for the main processing tools of our library.
